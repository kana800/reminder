<h3 align="center"> reminder </h3>

my personal reminder system; with the help of the [`vik-caldav`](https://github.com/kana800/vik-caldav) and [`automate-whatsapp-message`](https://github.com/kana800/automate-whatsapp-messages) this tiny program will go through my calendar and alert people in whatsapp messages. 

for example: remind `person-1` to buy milk; this will send a message `person-1` on _reminder date_.
